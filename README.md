# My-PThread

In this project I have created a user-level thread library using the pthread library as a template. Since it involves building the threads, implementation includes scheduling the threads to run and also mutual exclusion in the form of mutexes. Outcome of this project was that I got more understanding about some of the same scheduling issues faced by operating system designers when implementing Processes and kernel-level threads.
